I have used Chat Gpt 4.0 and Claude.ai for the question.

How does JWT Authentication work?

How can I structure an HTML form that toggles between ClickHouse and Flat File as the data source, dynamically showing relevant input fields using pure JavaScript?

What is Clickhouse Database?

How should I handle and display errors on the frontend, such as invalid JWT tokens or file upload issues, with user-friendly messages?

How can I execute a query in ClickHouse to fetch selected columns from a given table using the Java client and stream it to a CSV file efficiently?

Modify and make the given readme file into something more presentable and easy understanding? ( I had made a readme.md file based on my logic of code)
